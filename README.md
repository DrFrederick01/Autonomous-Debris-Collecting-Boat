# Autonomous-Debris-Collecting-Boat ðŸš¤

This was a group engineering project to design, build, and test a **proof-of-concept ship** that collects floating debris (40mm table tennis balls) in a water tank. I was responsible for the **control system**, including Arduino wiring and code.

##  Role & Responsibilities
- Connected and programmed the **Arduino IO3 Mini** with the **motor controller**.
- Used **Arduino IDE** to write and debug C++ control code.
- Ensured proper integration of movement and collection mechanisms.
- Supported testing and refinement in lab conditions.
- Built the ship using limited materials.

##  Scenario & Specs
- Target debris: 9 floating ping-pong balls (40mm diameter).
- Tank size: 1.2m x 1.2m, 250mm depth.
- Success = storing all debris without releasing it back.
- Time limit: 10 minutes per test.

## Project Highlights
- Designed to navigate water and trap debris in a central storage unit.
- Controlled speed and direction of motors for precise movement.
- Achieved successful trial run during timed challenge.

##  Tech Stack
- Arduino IO3 Mini
- Arduino IDE (C++)
- Motor Controller + Sensors
